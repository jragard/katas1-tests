# Assessment: JavaScript Katas 4 #

## To Run Tests as a Grader

1.  If you haven't already installed the kenzie-test npm package, from your terminal run `npm install --global git+https://github.com/jragard/kenzie-testing`

2.  To test a completed assignment from a Gitlab Project ID submission, run `kenzie-test katas4 -g <Project ID>`  (The student will need to submit their gitlab project ID number, and share their project with KA_SE5 Gitlab account) For example, `kenzie-test katas4 -g 10739614` will grab the contents of the file at https://gitlab.com/jragard/katas4.

3. To test a completed assignment from a github link, run `kenzie-test katas4 -g https://github.com/jragard/katas4` (or whatever the submitted github link happens to be)

4. To test a local file, the file and parent directory should be named according to assignment instructions (e.g. `katas4.js` and `katas4`).  Then run `kenzie-test katas4` (or appropriate assignment name) while in the local `katas4` directory.

## IMPORTANT TESTING BUG ##

Currently, when testing a file from a gitlab or github repo, the test won't run properly if the student doesn't name their file exactly `katas4.js` (this is case sensitive).  We already have been instructing students to name files specifically for our tests to work, but I could see the case sensitive issue coming up if students, for instance, name their file `Katas4.js`.  This is something I plan to fix at some point, but it's good to be aware of.  This issue stems from lines 19 and 22 in the run.js for this test suite.

### Overview ###

A [kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) is an individual exercise where you practice a programming skill through repetition. Today you will practice using JavaScript loops, conditionals, expressions and arrays through a series of katas.
Today you will practice using Javascript loops, conditionals, expressions, and arrays through a series of katas.

You will create a single web page to display the output from each of your functions, with a labeled heading for each individual exercise 
followed by your solution. **All outputs for the individual katas need to be displayed using `document.createElement()` and associated 
methods.** After appending the output of your function to the page, each function should use the 'return' statement to return its output.

Hint: when displaying an array, use `JSON.stringify()` to 'prettify' the output. For example, lets say you use `document.createElement()` 
and store it into a variable called `newElement`.  To display _`lotrCitiesArray`_ on this element, you can call:

`newElement.textContent = JSON.stringify(lotrCitiesArray);`

**Example**

```
    function kata1() {
        let newElement = document.createElement();
        newElement.textContent = JSON.stringify(lotrCitiesArray);
        document.body.appendChild(newElement)

        return lotrCitiesArray; // Don't forget to return your output!
    }
```
It might be beneficial to write a helper function to call within each kata, which could be responsible for taking care of creating new 
elements, appending text/content to the new elements, and then appending the new elements to the page.  However, this is not required.

Several of the katas will use the following sample variables, which you can copy and paste into your code:

```js
const gotCitiesCSV = "King's Landing,Braavos,Volantis,Old Valyria,Free Cities,Qarth,Meereen";
```

```js
const lotrCitiesArray = ["Mordor","Gondor","Rohan","Beleriand","Mirkwood","Dead Marshes","Rhun","Harad"];
```

```js
const bestThing = "The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong you are only off by a bit"
```
**Testing**

For this assessment, you will have access to testing tools as you work.  If you would like to test your work as you go, follow these instructions:

1. Make sure to name your file `katas4.js`.  Also, name each function `kata1()`, `kata2()`, and so on.  If you do not follow these instructions, the testing tools will not work.
2. From your command line shell, run 
`npm install --global git+https://github.com/jragard/kenzie-testing`
This will install the testing npm package.
3. While in the same directory as your `katas4.js` file, run the terminal command `kenzie-test katas4`.  You will receive instant feedback in your terminal.
